                        My first web game, written in pure JavaScript (soon to be
                        ported to WebAssembly in Rust). Blockery is an idle clicker
                        game about collecting blocks and building factories that make
                        more blocks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Originally named Blockery Web, Blockery is the third iteration
                        of its kind. Its first two versions were written in Java: the
                        first with the Java2D Swing framework and the second with
                        OpenGL to bring three dimensions to the blocks. Without a
                        proper version control system for either, both were destroyed
                        in a freak refactoring accident.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've since learned Git to hold on to all of my projects.
                        Blockery will live on this time.

                        A more recent project, silverfox is a plain-text
                        accounting tool written in Rust. It's still young, but
                        it's helping me budget my finances well with built-in
                        envelope budgeting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        silverfox aims to be a little more practical, helpful,
                        and opinionated than other existing plain-text
                        accounting tools and is largely inspired by hledger. It
                        will work from the terminal first, but will eventually
                        have its own GUI to make it easier to use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other than tracking my money, I put silverfox together
                        to also learn Rust. I've decided I really like it!

                        Targeted towards Linux desktop users, muse-status
                        provides system information in a beautiful format. It's
                        not a status bar, but a status <i>command</i>; it only
                        provides the output/text for a status bar like lemonbar,
                        i3-bar, or swaybar. It runs with a server-client model.
                        One daemon runs, and clients can connect to receive the
                        output status text. Clients can also send commands to
                        the status daemon to manually update information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        muse-status is part of the "Muse Suite".  The Muse
                        Suite is my own personal, open-source collection of
                        Linux desktop utilities to make the Linux desktop more
                        beautiful and practical. It's also supposed to be light
                        on resources like most Linux desktop programs.
                        Fittingly, the suite is named after the "muses" of
                        Greek mythology, which were the beautiful goddesses of
                        the arts and sciences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wrote muse-status in the Go programming language to
                        learn Go. muse-status is in the process of being
                        rewritten in Rust for even better background
                        performance. Additionally, I've learned a lot about the
                        Linux operating system and kernel while writing
                        muse-status.

            <p>
                I've always learned something new with each project I've
                created. I'm always eager to try something new with each new
                project.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to learning something new, I'll dive head-first
                into the material and tools I need to reach the goal. I'll work
                with others, collaborate with others, and work as best as I can
                to carry my team wherever we're going.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in reaching out for help, having an open mind, and
                always moving forward. If mistakes happen, I learn from them.
                There's nothing that can't be fixed.
